# Fivem - Speedlimiter

This script is a speedlimiter for FiveM. It's a simple script that allows you to set a speedlimit for vehicles. It's a client-sided script.

## Installation

1. Download the script
2. Put the script in your resources folder
3. Add `ensure ev_speedlimiter` to your server.cfg
4. Restart your server
5. Enjoy!

## Usage

To set a speedlimit, type `/limit <speed>` in the chat. Replace `<speed>` with the speed you want to set. For example: `/limit 100` will set the speedlimit to 100 km/h.
To remove the speedlimit, type `/limit` in the chat.

You can also enable the speedlimiter by pressing `E` on your keyboard. You can change this key in the `shared/sh_config.lua` file.

## Configuration

You can change the key to enable the speedlimiter in the `shared/sh_config.lua` file. You can also change the text that is displayed when you enable or disable the speedlimiter.

## Support

This project was made for fun and I'm not going to provide support for this script.
